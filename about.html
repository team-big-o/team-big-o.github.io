                <p>Team Big O was started from a simple idea: how could techies improve the living quality of their community using the skills they have? Big O was started with just four friends with a dream to spread awareness about the ecological and social impact that humans have with the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes have played an important role not only within the development of Canada but also its native inhabitants that have lived along their shores far before European settlers first came. The Canadian landscape has always been a source of fascination; the Group of Seven showed its flawless beauty for many around the globe. With the various functions the Great Lakes have played, they have become entrenched within the Canadian identity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our goal as inhabitants of the Great Lakes area should be to perpetuate the natural symbiotic relationship weâ€™ve had with the Lakes for many years. However, in recent years this relationship has grown increasingly toxic and harmful for the Lakes, with issues like waste and chemical pollution being provably damaging for them. The Great Lakes support much diversity with regards to flora and fauna; many species that depend on the Lakes for survival have found themselves struggling within recent years. If we as a community do not do something drastic to change the behaviours negatively impacting the Lakes, the irreparable damage will come back to bite us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At Big O, we believe that change within the community starts from the voices of leaders. As such, we have decided to take leadership in promoting the health of the land we inhabit, and educating the youth about its importance.</p>
