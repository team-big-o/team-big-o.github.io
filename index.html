                <p>Well, yes, you're not wrong. 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water. But a staggering 97.5% of that water is saline seawater, which isn't safe for human consumption or daily use. Only 2.5% of the water on Earth is potable freshwater, and of that 2.5%, only 0.3% is in liquid form on the surface of the Earth. The rest is either locked in frozen glaciers or underground reserves.</p>

                <strong>Why should I care?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>We often take access to clean water for granted, when there are families in less fortunate countries with little to no access to clean water. The average American family uses over 550 gallons of water a day, while the average African family only uses 5 gallons of water a day. The United Nations states that on average, one person needs approximately 5-13 gallons of water a day for drinking, cooking, and other essential life uses. Can you imagine life without enough clean water to drink and cook with? Water is extremely useful for daily human life, thanks to its properties such as the ability to dissolve almost any solute. More importantly, you can't survive for longer than three days without drinking water! If you're curious how much you depend on water, you can check at our <a href="calculator.html">Water Usage Calculator</a>. Going back to how water can dissolve solutes extremely well, however, this property of water is a double-edged sword. While it can dissolve useful solutes easily, it can also dissolve unwanted solutes easily, and hence, our freshwater lakes, such as Lake Erie, will easily be polluted if we don't make an effort to preserve them. We already have an extremely limited supply of freshwater, so every drop counts.</p>

                <strong>Well, can't we just purify some seawater if we run out of freshwater?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The technology exists, yes, but it is expensive and inefficient. We should therefore make the best effort possible to preserve our existing freshwater for future generations to use. This website will help you learn more about the importance of water in our lives, and how to keep our freshwater lakes clean and usable for many future generations to come.</p>

                <strong>What can I do to help?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>There is lots you can do to help, whether it's small things on a daily basis or taking part in larger charitable initiatives. On a daily basis, you could conserve water by taking shorter showers, watering the garden in the morning or evening instead of the afternoon, or fixing leaky toilets and faucets as soon as possible. If you want to set your sights on larger changes, look for a local charitable initiative that needs donations or volunteers!</p>
                <p>Speak out against activities that contaminate our freshwater, such as the burning of fossil fuels and the dumping of toxic chemicals. Aside from pollutants, overdevelopment, the draining of wetlands, and the filling of flood plains also compromises our access to freshwater and harms our lakes. These human activities, and more, are all very real threats to our lakes. Your voice matters, and if enough people speak up, things will change for the better!</p>
