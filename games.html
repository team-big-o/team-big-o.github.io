                <p class="purple">These three games highlight the importance of fresh water as a resource. While most citizens of developed countries, especially those living near large bodies of fresh water might take it for granted. Through these games, we hope to make it clear how precious fresh water is as a resource and hopefully inspire some reflection with our audiences. Scroll down to see them appear!</p>

                <br>
                <p>This game is designed for one player. Clean water is a precious commodity that we should not take for granted. Since every drop counts, you are tasked with running around with a bucket, collecting clean water while avoiding polluted water. Use the left and right arrow keys to move.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="white">This game is designed for two players to compete against one another. One person plays the role of a conservationist cleaning up the lake area, attempting to destroy the evil garbage monster which is controlled by the other player. Player 1 uses the arrow keys + mouse to aim and fire, while the garbage monster uses the WASD control layout, using SPACEBAR to attack.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="white">This game is designed for one player. In this game, you play as a garbage-collecting snake that eats up garbage, but has to avoid the expanding body of water so not to anger the marine life that lay within. Try to see how high of a score you can get!</p>
